771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3


SOLUTION: Intuitive using HashMao /HashSet

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        HashMap<Character,Integer> hmap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for(char c : S.toCharArray()){
            hmap.put(c, hmap.getOrDefault(c,0)+1);
        }
        
           
        int count = 0;
        for(char c : J.toCharArray()){
            if(hmap.containsKey(c)){
                count += hmap.get(c);
            }
        }
        
        
        return count;
    }
}
